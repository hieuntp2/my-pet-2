# Active Backlog — Animation-First AI Pet

## Rules for AutoDev

- Select only one task per run.
- Prefer the first incomplete task.
- Do not skip ahead unless status says the current task is done.
- Do not implement camera/audio/cloud/robot body.
- Keep diff small.
- Build after every task.
- Commit only if build passes.
